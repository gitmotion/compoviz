## ✨ Key Features

### 🎨 Visual Architecture Mapping
*   **Pro-Grade Diagrams**: Automatically generates professional-grade architecture diagrams using an enhanced Mermaid.js engine.
*   **Logical Grouping**: Services are visually grouped by their **Docker Networks**.
*   **Edge Intelligence**: `depends_on` conditions (`healthy`, `started`) are visualized as labeled paths.
*   **Infrastructure Insights**: Visualizes host path mounts, named volumes, secrets, and configs at a glance.

### 🔍 Multi-Project Comparison
*   **Collision Detection**: Load up to 3 different `docker-compose.yml` files simultaneously.
*   **Conflict Analysis**: Real-time detection of port collisions, duplicate container names, and shared host volumes.
*   **Cross-Project Visualization**: See how distinct projects interact via shared networks or shared infrastructure.

### 🛠️ Robust Service Editor
*   **Spec-Compliant**: Built for the modern [Compose Specification](https://compose-spec.io/) (no more obsolete `version: '3.8'`).
*   **Smart Templates**: Instantly spin up standardized configurations for Redis, PostgreSQL, Nginx, MongoDB, and more.
*   **Field Validation**: Real-time warnings for missing images, undefined network references, and duplicate resource names.
*   **Rich Controls**: Full support for environment variables, `.env` files, healthchecks, entrypoints, and user permissions.

### ⌨️ Developer Experience
*   **Undo/Redo**: Full history management with `Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Y` shortcuts.
*   **Glassmorphism UI**: A stunning "Cyberpunk" dark mode interface designed for maximum focus.
*   **Instant Export**: Export clean, optimized YAML ready for production.
